# Notes for week2 day 2

## Outline

1) How functions are defined 

2) Why do we want to use callbacks? 

3) What is asyncronicity

4) Events 

5) Nesting 

### Functions

inputs, processing, outputs. Everything in computing can be broken down to one of these things. 

### Callback 

Callback -> when we call a function as a parameter in another function. Callbacks are a particlar type of function that is used 

### Asyncronicity

2 types of function: 

1) syncronous Functions
  functions that run in order
2) Asyncronous Functions
  functions that are put on the backburner until they have finished compiling, and then run. 

  Nothing on the back burner until the main thread is finished. 

When we use Asyncronous Functions we are creating multiple thread within a program

So we have main thread and backburner. The back burner only gets executed once the amin thread has completed. 

e.g: if you have a doctors appointment at 3, and you show up and there is a line, you still need to wait to get it, if there isn't a line then you get to go at 3.
